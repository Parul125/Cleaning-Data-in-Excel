This project involves cleaning and preprocessing raw data in an Excel file to ensure accuracy, consistency, and usability for analysis. The dataset may contain errors such as duplicate entries, missing values, inconsistent formatting, and incorrect data types. The goal is to standardize the dataset by applying various data cleaning techniques, including:

Handling Missing Data: Filling missing values using appropriate methods or removing incomplete records.
Removing Duplicates: Identifying and eliminating duplicate rows to maintain data integrity.
Standardizing Formats: Ensuring uniform date, number, and text formats.
Correcting Errors: Fixing misspellings, misclassifications, or inconsistent entries.
Data Validation: Applying filters, conditional formatting, and rules to maintain accuracy.
Removing Unwanted Characters: Eliminating extra spaces, special symbols, or unnecessary formatting.

This cleaned and structured data file can be used for further analysis, visualization, or integration into other systems.
